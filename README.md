# MachineLearning4EEGinMaster-Updating

* updating another document for a project, now temporarily postpone this project update.

This is the folder for rewriting the code used for EEG signal processing during my master's degree, rewritten according to memory

## The content mainly includes these part:
* matalb code for preprocessing
* python-Keras code for building the neural network
* python-Pytorch code for building the same network
* python-Pytorch code for NLP (encoder and decoder with/without attention)
* python-Pytorch code for CV (CNNs for simple dataset)
* python-Pytorch code for time series segmentation (testing edition)
