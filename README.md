# MachineLearning4EEGinMSc
This is the folder for rewriting the code used for EEG signal processing during my master's degree, rewritten according to memory
The content mainly includes three part:
1. matalb code for preprocessing
2. python-Keras code for building the neural network
3. python-Pytorch code for building the same network
